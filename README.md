## ‚öôÔ∏è Design/Features

- Simple roll of the dice game with statistics for rolls to avoid having an oversimplified case and allow for some navigation and state managment
- Number of rolls available are limited to 3 maximum, requiring a payment if it reaches 0. Resetting to max if payment was completed.
- If the roll is guess is correct, it resets to the maximum just like a payment would.

Dev and Prod variants are available which can be chosen via BuildVariants and run on Android Studio.

## üõ† Tech Notes

This sample app attempts to use modern android development techniques as a validation gateway, with the following relevant takeways.
* Uses `Version Catalog` for the libraries management, a simple TOML file
* Proposes a Modularisation strategy
* Uses `Convention Plugins` up all modules and simplfy boilerplate in module creation and dependency management.
* Uses `Jetpack Compose` for the entire UI, with Single Activity
* Uses various `Jetpack` libraries for navigation, splash, accompanist, etc
* Uses `Kotlin Courotines` for the entire app
* Uses `Kotlin Result` for improved and forced error handling
* Uses `Retrofit` for network calls, with a custom adapter
* Uses `Hilt` for dependency injection

## Limitations

Since this app is still under development, some features may not be fully developed.
